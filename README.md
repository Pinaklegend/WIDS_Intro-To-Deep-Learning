# WIDS_Intro-To-Deep-Learning

## Section 1
Week one of this project will begin with familiarizing ourselves with Python coding, relevant libraries, and attaining a reasonable proficiency in this language. Given that many of you have some coding background, not necessarily in Python but in other languages, this task should be easy yet essential for us to advance. Hence, we have uploaded YouTube links and resources to the GitHub repository below.  Kindly refer to Section 1 to find these link. All  information and content will from now on be uploaded to thisÂ repository.

We will be posting all the relevant content on this github repository.
