#WEEK 2

Now that we have made ouselves comfortable python coding and Numpy it is time to start our jounrey on Neural Networking. You can start by following the below resources for the same. During this week you will become
acquainted with Artificial Neural Networks, which have proven to be highly effective in solving complex problems of different domains. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are versatile machine learning models inspired
by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers that process input data to produce output. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized type of ANN, excel in image
recognition by leveraging convolutional layers.
