# WEEK 1
Week one of this project will begin with familiarizing ourselves with Python coding, relevant libraries, and attaining a reasonable proficiency in this language. Given that many of you have some coding background, not necessarily in Python but in other languages, this task should be easy yet essential for us to advance. Hence, we have uploaded YouTube links and resources to the GitHub repository below.  Kindly refer to Section 1 to find these link.


## SECTION 1

We'll begin by mastering Python. Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive platform for coding, data visualization, and documentation. It's an ideal environment for 
Python. Check out the installation procedure in the linked playlist.
