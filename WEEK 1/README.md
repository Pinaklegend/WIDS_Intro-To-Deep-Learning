# WEEK 1
Week one of this project will begin with familiarizing ourselves with Python coding, relevant libraries, and attaining a reasonable proficiency in this language. Given that many of you have some coding background, not necessarily in Python but in other languages, this task should be easy yet essential for us to advance. Hence, we have uploaded YouTube links and resources to the GitHub repository below.  Kindly refer to Section 1 to find these link.


## SECTION 1

We'll begin by mastering Python. Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive platform for coding, data visualization, and documentation. It's an ideal environment for 
Python. Check out the installation procedure in the linked playlist.

Try to complete the above in 2-3 days to get a good grasp of this language.

## SECTION 2
There is no need of memorizing all the libraries function. HOwever it is necessary to have a basic idea. This will help you mainly in the assignments. Keep referring to these whenever needed. 

### Numpy
NumPy is a crucial Python library for scientific computing, featuring multi-dimensional array support, matrices, and a suite of mathematical functions. Widely employed in machine learning, data analysis, and scientific research. Usually used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. Watch the following tutorial for good understanding.
