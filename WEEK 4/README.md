# Final Porject

Welcome to the last part of this LS course, the final project.

## Your task: To fine-tune a pre-trained model for a specific downstream task, and create a simple demo app to interact with it

Roughly, the project can be split into 3 parts:

Conclude project details by selecting a base model, defining the training task and dataset. Script the model training, save it locally, and utilize Gradio for a user-friendly demo application, allowing personalized interaction with the fine-tuned model.You can find some datasets on Kaggle, Hugging Face or from one of the example projects.

## Submission Guidelines

The file you have used for training the model, be it a notebook or just a Python file. The file should be well documented (with comments/text cells), and should explain the purpose of each block of code. Failure to do so will lead to rejection of your submission.A README containing details on your project: the model, task and dataset. Include any unique challenges you faced whilst doing the project (.txt or .md, either words)(optional).
